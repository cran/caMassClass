Changes:
1) from version 1.0 to 1.1:
  - bin2raw and raw2bin files: endian variable was added
  - raw2bin: additional error checking
  - runmean, runmax, runmin, runquantile, runmad: additional error checking and
    corrected error checking
  - EndRule: added error checking
  - runmean, runmax, runmin: additional parameter "alg" was added
  - runmean - new C code can survive round-off errors
  - several generic functions were moved to a new "caTools" package
  - msc.split.data renamed to split.data and moved to "caTools". Shell function
    "msc.split.data" still provided which works with the warning.
  - read.mzXML and write.mzXML functions were added

2) from version 1.1 to 1.2
  - following functions were added:
       msc.peaks.write.mzXML
       msc.peaks.read.mzXML
       msc.rawMS.write.mzXML
       msc.rawMS.read.mzXML
   - function 'msc.msfiles.read.csv' was renamed to 'msc.rawMS.read.csv'
   - in functions 'msc.peaks.write.csv' and 'msc.biomarkers.write.csv'
     order of arguments was swapt from '(fname, X)' to '(X, fname)' in order to 
     be consistent with other functions in the package
   - functions 'msc.peaks.write.csv' and 'msc.peaks.read.csv' got better error 
     checking
 3) version 1.3
  - better integration of mzXML data in the flow of the functions
