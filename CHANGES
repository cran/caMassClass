Changes:
1) from version 1.0 to 1.1:
  - bin2raw and raw2bin files: endian variable was added
  - raw2bin: additional error checking
  - runmean, runmax, runmin, runquantile, runmad: additional error checking and
    corrected error checking
  - EndRule: added error checking
  - runmean, runmax, runmin: additional parameter "alg" was added
  - runmean - new C code can survive round-off errors
  - several generic functions were moved to a new "caTools" package
  - msc.split.data renamed to split.data and moved to "caTools". Shell function
    "msc.split.data" still provided which works with the warning.
  - read.mzXML and write.mzXML functions were added

2) from version 1.1 to 1.2
  - following functions were added:
       msc.peaks.write.mzXML
       msc.peaks.read.mzXML
       msc.rawMS.write.mzXML
       msc.rawMS.read.mzXML
   - function 'msc.msfiles.read.csv' was renamed to 'msc.rawMS.read.csv'
   - in functions 'msc.peaks.write.csv' and 'msc.biomarkers.write.csv'
     order of arguments was swapt from '(fname, X)' to '(X, fname)' in order to 
     be consistent with other functions in the package
   - functions 'msc.peaks.write.csv' and 'msc.peaks.read.csv' got better error 
     checking
 3) version 1.3
  - better integration of mzXML data in the flow of the functions
 4) version 1.4
  - INTERFACE CHANGE: msc.*.read.mzXML functions switched from outputing list 
    with 'scans' and 'mzXML' fields to outputing scans with mzXML attached as
    attribute. That was done to make it consistent with other functions in the 
    package. 
  - Improved automatic self-checking through use of 'stopifnot' function 
    throughout the examples.
  - msc.*.read.csv functions got a new argument "mzXML.record=FALSE" that allows
    for creation and storing of meta-data
  - msc.*.read.mzXML functions got a new argument "wipe=TRUE" that controls if 
    samples returned from the function should be removed from mzXML data.
  - better integration of mzXML data in the flow of the functions
  - added more documentation to caMassClass/inst/doc directory
