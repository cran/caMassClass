This package was produced as part of National Cancer Institute's caBIG project
(https://cabig.nci.nih.gov/) and is also aviable for download from NCI Center 
for Bioinformatics (http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/download/index.jsp) website as 
well as CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org/) website. 

The package was tested on SELDI data produced by:
- Center for Prostate Disease Research (http://www.cpdr.org/) 
- Eastern Virginia Medical School's The Virginia Prostate Center 
  (http://www.evms.edu/vpc/seldi/index.html) 
- NCI's Center for Cancer Research 
  (http://home.ccr.cancer.gov/ncifdaproteomics/ppatterns.asp)

Planned future work on the package include:
- more testing and improvements to classification section of the package
- adding support to mzXML (http://tools.proteomecenter.org/mzXMLschema.php) 
  data format
- more examples on real data aviable for download

There are two related packages, I know about:
- PROcess - "A package for processing protein mass spectrometry data"
- ppc - "Sample classification of protein mass spectra by peak probabilty 
        contrasts"
Aviable from CRAN and BioConductor websites.
