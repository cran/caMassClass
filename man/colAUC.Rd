\title{Columnwise Area Under ROC Curve (AUC)}
\description{Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) calculated for every column of the 
  matrix.}
\synopsis{colAUC(X, y, p.val=FALSE)}
\usage{
  auc = colAUC(X, y)
  p   = colAUC(X, y, p.val=TRUE)
}

\arguments{
  \item{X}{A matrix or data frame. Rows contain samples 
    and columns contain features/variables.}
  \item{y}{Class labels for the \code{X} data samples. 
    A response vector with one label for each row/component of \code{X}.
    Can be either a factor, string or a numeric vector.}
  \item{p.val}{a boolean flag: if set to TRUE than "Wilcoxon rank sum test" 
    p-values (see \code{\link{wilcox.test}}) will be returned instead of AUC 
    values}
}

\details{
  AUC is a very useful measure of similarity between two classes measuring area
  under "Receiver Operating Characteristic" or ROC curve.
  In case of data with no ties all sections of ROC curve are either horizontal
  or vertical, in case of data with ties diagonal 
  sections can also occur. Area under the ROC curve is calculated using 
  \code{\link{trapz}} function. AUC is always in between 0.5 
  (two classes are statistically identical) and 1.0 (there is a threshold value
   that can achieve a perfect separation between the classes).
  
  This measure is very similar to Wilcoxon rank sum test (see 
  \code{\link{wilcox.test}}), which is also called 
  Mann-Whitney test. Wilcoxon-test's p-value can be calculated by 
  \code{p=pnorm( n1*n2*(1-auc), mean=n1*n2/2, sd=sqrt(n1*n2*(n1+n2+1)/12) )} 
  where \code{n1} and \code{n2} are numbers of elements in two classes being 
  compared.
  
  The main purpose of this function was to calculate AUC's of large number of 
  features, fast. It is being used to help with classification of protein mass 
  spectra data 
  that often have up to 50K features, as a fast and dirty way of lowering 
  dimensionality of the data before applying standard classification algorithms 
  like \code{nnet} or \code{svd}.

\value{
  An output is a single matrix with the same number of columns as \code{X} and 
  "n choose 2" ( \eqn{\frac{n!}{(n-2)! 2!}}{n!/((n-2)! 2!)} ) number of rows, 
  where n is number of unique labels in \code{y} list. For example, if \code{y} 
  contains only two unique class labels ( \code{length(unique(lab))==2} ) than
  output 
  matrix will  have a single row containing AUC of each column. If more than 
  two unique labels are present than AUC is calculated for every possible 
  pairing of classes ("n choose 2" of them).
